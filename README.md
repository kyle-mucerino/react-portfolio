# react-portfolio

For the React portfolio, we wanted to create a professional profile that uses React to render cotent. We have a Header & Footer component that appears on every page of the site as well as a navigation component that allows the user to find pages such as an "About Me" section, a page for previous projects, a page that shows my resume and linkedin profile, as well as a contact page for a user to leave their name and email.
